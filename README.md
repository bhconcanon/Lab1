# Lab1

This is a Jenkinsfile with a declarative pipeline that prints output for "Hello World" ; There are 2 stages:

## Hello World Stage

This runs echo output for "Hello World"

## Email Stage

This send the results, if succeeded, to selected emails with a link to the console output.

*NOTE:* Need to add alert for when job fails.
